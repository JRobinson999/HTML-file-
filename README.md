The website "Enchanted Beauty" is designed a recreation to the website Ulta Beauty.  It presents a clean, visually appealing interface with the following key elements:


Homepage: A slideshow banner, welcome message, services overview, FAQ section, a testimonial, contact form with a map, and about us section.
Navigation: A simple horizontal menu with links to "Home," "Our Services," "About Us," and "Contact."
Responsive Design: The site is designed to adapt to different screen sizes.
Contact Form: Allows users to submit inquiries.
Footer: Contains copyright information 

The HTML file (index.html) provides the structure of the website. It includes a header with navigation, a slideshow (carousel), welcome section, services overview, FAQ section, a testimonial, contact form, and an about us section.
Meta tags are used for character set, viewport settings, and title.
Links to Bootstrap CSS and custom CSS (style.css) are included in the <head>.
Links to Bootstrap JavaScript are placed before the closing </body> tag. It's important to include JavaScript at the end of the body to ensure the DOM is loaded before the scripts execute.
CSS Styling:

The CSS file (style.css) styles the HTML elements. It sets the font, background colors, padding, and other visual properties.
Basic styles are applied to the header, navigation, carousel, cards (for services), buttons, and the footer.
The object-fit: cover; property is used on images to prevent distortion while maintaining aspect ratio.
JavaScript Functionality:

The JavaScript file (script.js) adds interactivity to the website.
The jQuery $(document).ready() function ensures that the script runs after the DOM is fully loaded.
Form Submission Handling: An event listener is attached to the contact form's submit event. When the form is submitted:
event.preventDefault() prevents the default form submission behavior (which would typically reload the page).
$(this).serialize() gathers the form data into a string.
setTimeout() simulates an AJAX request. In a real implementation, you would replace this with an actual AJAX call to send the form data to a server-side script for processing.
After the simulated delay, a success message is displayed in the #formMessage element, and the form is reset using $('#contactForm')[0].reset().
